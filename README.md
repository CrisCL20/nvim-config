# vimrc config file

In this repo I put my personal neovim ``.vimrc`` config file, including ``init.vim`` (this goes into ``~/.config/nvim``) and ``.vim``, hope you like it! Its my first decent config file so i wanted to save it. Also this is done in alacritty term with monocraft font, I included neofetch configuration for future uses :}
